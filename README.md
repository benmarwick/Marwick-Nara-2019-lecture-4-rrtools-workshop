# Writing reproducible research with R and Markdown, a Workshop at 20th Anniversary Conference of the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences (CSSS) at the University of Washington 

I presented a workshop on using the [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) package to easily make reproducble manuscripts. More on the 20th Anniversary Conference is online here https://www.csss.washington.edu/about/anniversary

This was a hands-on activity, with the participants given these instructions in advance: 

1. Bring a laptop and power supply so you can charge the battery during the day     

2. Before coming to the workshop download and install onto your laptop these *three* free programs (accepting all default options during installation, even if you have previously installed these in the past, please update them now, we need the latest versions):

a. R for Windows (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) or OSX (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg)

b. RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

c. Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

3. Create a free account for yourself on http://github.com, this is useful for working with the Git version control system

4. If you have any questions before the workshop, please send an email to me at bmarwick@uw.edu
